## Hi there 👋
## MERN Stack
🙋‍♀️ Building Applications with the MERN Stack can be as easy or as hard as you make it. While learning how to develop applications using the MERN stack I often found myself going in circles or having a had time understanding some of the documentation for these technologies. There are also a lot of different libraries and methods for doing things and they way things are done is based on project requirement and a host of other things. I created this Organization to help myself and other developers navigate the learning process and also to have a place of reference for a lot of common functionalities in hopes of making the learning and development process easier. I started creating this guide in December 2023 and it is still a long way from being complete. Check back often to see what updates we have made, as of now there are only two developers working on this project, so if there are any developers out there that would like to contribute please email mernstackadmin@asordevelopment.com
